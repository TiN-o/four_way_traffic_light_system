Four-Way Traffic Light Control System
Developed with CADe_SIMU

📌 Introduction
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a four-way traffic light control system using CADe_SIMU, an electrical circuit simulation software. The system models real-world traffic management at a four-way intersection, ensuring safe and efficient vehicle movement by controlling signal phases.

🎯 Objectives
To design a functional traffic light control system for a four-way intersection.

To simulate the timing sequence of red, yellow, and green lights.

To apply electrical engineering concepts in circuit simulation and automation.

To showcase practical problem-solving skills in traffic management systems.

⚙️ Tools & Technologies
Software: CADe_SIMU (Electrical circuit simulation tool)

Components: Timers, relays, switches, and indicator lamps (representing traffic lights)

Methodology: Sequential control logic for traffic phases

🛠️ System Design
The system is structured around a sequential timing cycle:

North–South Green, East–West Red

North–South Yellow, East–West Red

North–South Red, East–West Green

North–South Red, East–West Yellow

Each phase is controlled using timers and relays to ensure smooth transitions and avoid conflicts. The design mimics real-world traffic light operation, with adjustable timing parameters for flexibility.

📊 Simulation Results
The simulation successfully cycles through all four phases.

No overlap occurs between conflicting directions.

The timing sequence can be modified to suit different traffic conditions.

The system demonstrates reliability and scalability for larger intersections.

📈 Applications
Educational demonstrations in electrical and electronic engineering.

Prototype for real-world traffic control systems.

Foundation for integrating sensors, microcontrollers, or PLCs for smart traffic management.

🚀 Future Improvements
Integration with microcontrollers (Arduino/PLC) for hardware implementation.

Addition of pedestrian crossing signals.

Adaptive control using traffic sensors and machine learning algorithms.
